# Input Data
activity_labels.txt contains the code number and name of the 6 activities
features.txt contains the complete list of 561 variables of each feature vector

Under subfolder test (2,947 observations per file with no header)
subject_test.txt contains identification code of subject observed 
X_test.txt contains the 561 columns of variable data recorded when observation was made
y_test.txt contains the activity code recorded when observation was made

Under subfolder train (7,352 observations per file with no header)
subject_train.txt contains identification code of subject observed 
X_train.txt contains the 561 columns of variable data recorded when observation was made
y_train.txt contains the activity code recorded when observation was made

Under subfolder Intertial Signals
Data files are not required

# Data transformation
Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
- Read train data files into respective train dataframes and combine by rows
- Read test data files into respective train dataframes and combine by rows
- Combine dataframes by columns to get a single dataframe
Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- Use only feature names with mean and std
- Modify and apply feature names for better readability, e.g. tBodyAcc-mean()-X changed to timeBodyAccMeanX 

Step 5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- Reshape data using melt and dcast then write data to data.txt file
